<h1 id="nginx-letsencrypt-docker-multistack-web-app">nginx + letsencrypt + docker = multistack web app</h1>
<p><strong>Difficulty Level</strong>: entry</p>
<p>Imagine that we have a few different web services which work on different languages, environment with its own configuration set.</p>
<p>What would be the approach of running applications on staging or live environment easily without overengineering and easy deployment process with CI pipelines.</p>
<p>Obvious first response is to use <strong>docker</strong> for wrapping our applications into different environmemts.</p>
<p>But how would we route traffic from incoming requests into various docker containers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use <strong>nginx</strong> as a reverse proxy and route traffic based on domain name or path name.</p>
<p>And for taste of being encrypted and have all those services and microservices behind https we use free <strong>Let’s encrypt</strong> certificates and their bot to keep certificates and configuration up-to-date automatically.</p>

<p>We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a FQDN: example.com</li>
<li>a VPS or bare metal server</li>
<li>an api backend web application wrapped into a container image (let’s call it <code>api-container</code>)</li>
<li>a SPA web application wrapped into another container image (let’s call it <code>spa-container</code>)</li>
</ul>
