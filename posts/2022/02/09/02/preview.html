<h1 id="nginx-letsencrypt-docker-multistack-web-app">nginx + letsencrypt + docker = multistack web app</h1>
<p>Imagine that we have a few different web services which work on different languages, environment with its own configuration set.</p>
<p>What would be the approach of running applications on staging or live environment easily without overengineering and easy deployment process with CI pipelines.</p>
<p>Obvious first response is to use <code>docker</code> for wrapping our applications into different environmemts.</p>
<p>But how would we route traffic from incoming requests into various docker containers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use <code>nginx</code> as a reverse proxy and route traffic based on domain name or path name.</p>
<p>And for taste of being encrypted and have all those services and microservices behind https we use free <code>Let's encrypt</code> certificates and their bot to keep everything up-to-date automatically.</p>
