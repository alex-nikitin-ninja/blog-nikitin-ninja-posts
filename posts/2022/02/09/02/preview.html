<h1 id="nginx-letsencrypt-docker-multistack-web-app">nginx + letsencrypt + docker = multistack web app</h1>
<p>Imagine that we have a few different web services which work on different languages, configuration and environment.</p>
<p>What would be the approach of running them application locally or on live environment easily without overengineering and easy deployment process with CI pipelines.</p>
<p>Obvious first response is to use docker for our applications in different environmemt.</p>
<p>But how would we route traffic from incoming requests into various docker containers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use nginx as a reverse proxy and route traffic based on domain name or path name.</p>
<p>And for taste of being encrypted and work all those services and microservices behind https we use free letâ€™s encrypt certificates and their bots to keep everything updated automatically.</p>
