# `docker` shortcuts

Difficulty level: **low**

Containerization is an excellent way of applications isolation and Docker is one
the most popular tools which allow us to do that.

Alternative to docker could be 

- Podman
- LXD
- Containerd.
- RunC
- Buildah
- BuildKit
- Kaniko

The first 3 sounded familiar to me, though the last 4 is something to take
consider.
